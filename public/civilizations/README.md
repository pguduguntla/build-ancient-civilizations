# Civilization images

Add exactly 3 images here. They are used in the civilization picker and as the starting scene for each game (no initial image is generated).

**Required filenames:**

- `rome.jpg` — Ancient Rome (or `rome.png`)
- `india.jpg` — Ancient India (or `india.png`)
- `egypt.jpg` — Ancient Egypt (or `egypt.png`)

Use `.jpg` or `.png`; the app looks for both. Recommended: landscape, evocative of each civilization.
